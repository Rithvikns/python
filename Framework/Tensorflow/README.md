# TensorFlow Overview

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google Brain. It is widely used for deep learning applications and provides tools for training and deploying machine learning models.

## Features of TensorFlow
- **Scalability**: Supports CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs(Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are Google's custom-developed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) used to accelerate machine learning workloads) for efficient computation.
- **Flexibility**: Works with deep learning, reinforcement learning, and traditional machine learning.
- **Ecosystem**: Includes TensorFlow Hub, TensorFlow Extended (TFX), and TensorFlow Lite.
- **Auto Differentiation**: Uses TensorFlowâ€™s `tf.GradientTape` for automatic differentiation.
- **Pretrained Models**: Provides access to pre-trained models via TensorFlow Hub.

## Installation
To install TensorFlow using pip, run:
```sh
pip install tensorflow
```
For GPU support, use:
```sh
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

## Basic Example
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple computation
a = tf.constant(2.0)
b = tf.constant(3.0)
c = a + b
print(c.numpy())  # Output: 5.0
```

## TensorFlow Components
1. **Tensors**: Multi-dimensional arrays similar to NumPy arrays.
2. **Graphs and Sessions**: (TF1.x) Computational graphs for efficient execution.
3. **Keras API**: High-level deep learning API (`tf.keras`).
4. **Dataset API**: Handling large datasets efficiently (`tf.data`).
5. **TF Lite**: For deploying models on mobile and edge devices.
6. **TF Serving**: For serving trained models in production.

## Creating a Neural Network with TensorFlow/Keras
```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define model
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Summary
model.summary()
```

## Training a Model
```python
import numpy as np

# Generate random data
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(2, size=(1000,))

# Train model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

## TensorFlow Ecosystem
- **TensorFlow Hub**: Repository of pre-trained models.
- **TensorFlow Lite**: Lightweight ML models for mobile and IoT.
- **TensorFlow.js**: Running models in browsers using JavaScript.
- **TensorFlow Extended (TFX)**: End-to-end ML pipeline.

## Deployment with TensorFlow Serving
To serve a trained model:
```sh
tensorflow_model_server --rest_api_port=8501 --model_name=my_model --model_base_path=/models/my_model/
```
## tf.Variable
tf.Variable is used to store and update model parameters (such as weights and biases) during training. It maintains state across multiple function calls and is trainable by default.

Key Features:


- Holds mutable tensors that persist across different computations.
- Automatically tracks changes for gradient computation during backpropagation.
- Used in defining deep learning models.

  
Example:
python
```console
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a variable with an initial value
x = tf.Variable(initial_value=5.0, trainable=True)

# Update its value
x.assign(10.0)  # Changes the value of x to 10
print(x.numpy())  # Output: 10.0
```

## tf.placeholder (Deprecated in TF 2.x)

tf.placeholder was used in TensorFlow 1.x to create a tensor whose values are fed at runtime.
It was primarily used to build computational graphs without providing input data immediately.


In TensorFlow 2.x, tf.function and eager execution replace tf.placeholder.
Example (TensorFlow 1.x, NOT recommended for TF 2.x)
```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=[None, 3])  # A placeholder for a batch of 3-element vectors
```
## Alternative in TensorFlow 2.x:
Use tf.function and pass tensors as arguments instead.
```console
@tf.function
def compute(x):
    return x * 2

print(compute(tf.constant([1, 2, 3])))
```
