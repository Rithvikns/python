# Introduction to Scikit-learn

## What is Scikit-learn?
Scikit-learn is an open-source machine learning library for Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining, data analysis, and machine learning, built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. Scikit-learn is widely used for building machine learning models in academic research and industry applications.

## What is Scikit-learn Used For?
### 1. **Supervised Learning**
- **Classification** (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes)
- **Regression** (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression)

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Clustering** (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)
- **Dimensionality Reduction** (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, LDA)

### 3. **Model Selection and Evaluation**
- Cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)
- Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, RMSE, etc.)

### 4. **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing**
- Scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)
- Encoding categorical variables (OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder)
- Handling missing values (SimpleImputer)

### 5. **Pipeline and Workflow Automation**
- Automates the machine learning workflow by combining preprocessing and model training steps.

## Example: Building a Simple Machine Learning Model with Scikit-learn
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
data = load_iris()
X, y = data.data, data.target

# Split dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Feature Scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train a RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
```
