# Coding Problems

Coding problems are an essential way to develop problem-solving skills, improve logical thinking, and strengthen programming knowledge. They range from simple tasks like reversing a string to complex challenges involving data structures, algorithms, and optimization techniques. Solving these problems helps programmers understand fundamental concepts such as recursion, dynamic programming, graph traversal, and sorting algorithms.

## Coding Problems - My Journey to Problem-Solving Excellence  

Solving coding problems is an essential part of becoming a better programmer and improving problem-solving skills. Whether preparing for coding interviews, participating in competitive programming, or simply sharpening logical thinking, tackling a variety of algorithmic challenges is crucial. This repository is a collection of coding problems I have solved, covering a wide range of topics, including data structures, algorithms, dynamic programming, and system design. By consistently working on these problems, I aim to enhance my ability to write efficient, clean, and optimized code.  

My primary focus is on solving problems from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank, and GeeksforGeeks. Each solution is well-documented with explanations, optimized approaches, and alternative solutions where applicable. I strive to improve my understanding of core concepts such as recursion, graph theory, bit manipulation, and advanced algorithms like backtracking and divide-and-conquer. This repository serves as a personal learning resource and a way to track my progress over time.  

Through this journey, I hope to build confidence in tackling complex problems and develop an intuitive grasp of algorithmic thinking. I believe consistency is key, and by solving coding challenges regularly, I can strengthen my problem-solving mindset. Feel free to explore the solutions, contribute, or suggest improvements. Let's learn and grow together! ðŸš€
