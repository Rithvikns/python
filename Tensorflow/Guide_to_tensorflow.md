## Key Concepts in TensorFlow

### 1. Tensors
- **Definition**: A tensor is a multi-dimensional array that serves as the fundamental building block in TensorFlow.
- **Types**:
  - Scalars (0D tensors)
  - Vectors (1D tensors)
  - Matrices (2D tensors)
  - Higher-dimensional tensors

### 2. Computational Graph
- TensorFlow builds a computational graph where nodes represent operations and edges represent tensors.
- It enables parallel processing and optimization.

### 3. Sessions (Deprecated in TensorFlow 2.x)
- Used in TensorFlow 1.x for executing graphs, but replaced by eager execution in TensorFlow 2.x.

### 4. Variables and Constants
- **Constants**: Immutable values used in models.
- **Variables**: Trainable parameters that update during training.

### 5. Placeholders (Deprecated in TensorFlow 2.x)
- Previously used for feeding data into graphs; replaced by `tf.data` pipelines.

## Training Process in TensorFlow

### 1. Epoch
- **Definition**: One complete pass through the entire dataset.
- **Significance**: More epochs help improve model performance but can lead to overfitting if excessive.

### 2. Batch Size
- **Definition**: The number of samples processed before updating model parameters.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Small batch size: More updates, higher computational cost.
  - Large batch size: Faster training, but may generalize poorly.

### 3. Optimizers
Optimizers adjust the model parameters to minimize the loss function.
#### Common Optimizers:
- **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**: Updates weights using a small batch of data.
- **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**: Combines advantages of RMSprop and momentum.
- **RMSprop**: Adapts learning rate for different parameters.
- **Adagrad**: Adapts learning rates for each parameter separately.

### 4. Loss Functions
- **Definition**: A function that measures how well the modelâ€™s predictions match the actual values.
#### Common Loss Functions:
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Regression tasks.
- **Binary Crossentropy**: Binary classification.
- **Categorical Crossentropy**: Multi-class classification.

### 5. Activation Functions
- Introduce non-linearity to the model.
#### Common Activation Functions:
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Used in hidden layers.
- **Sigmoid**: Used in binary classification.
- **Softmax**: Used in multi-class classification.

## Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measures correctness of predictions.
- **Precision & Recall**: Used in imbalanced datasets.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides insight into classification errors.

---
## Model Deployment
- **SavedModel Format**: Used for exporting models.
- **TensorFlow Serving**: Deploys models for real-time predictions.
- **TensorFlow Lite**: Optimized for mobile and edge devices.
- **TensorFlow.js**: Runs models in browsers.
